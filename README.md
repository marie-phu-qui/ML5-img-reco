# Image recognition unising machine learning library ML5

This project is an image recognition tool using Python and the machine learning library ML5 based on Tensorflow.
I am using the training exemples from the [ML5 documentation](https://ml5js.org/docs/getting-started.html).

# `Legolas what do your elf eyes see`

This project extends my EDA final group project [Lord of the News](https://github.com/marie-phu-qui/Lord-of-the-News).
The model will be trained to recognise user uploaded image content with an Elf eye precision.
